# 👥 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 💡 Overview
This project applies unsupervised machine learning (K-Means Clustering) to segment customers into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior.  
It helps businesses understand different customer profiles and target them with personalized marketing strategies.

## 🧠 Objective
To identify unique customer segments using clustering techniques and provide data-driven insights for marketing decisions.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Load and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, normalize data).  
2. Use **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters (k).  
3. Apply **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers.  
4. Visualize the clusters using 2D/3D plots.  

## 📊 Results
- The model identifies clear customer segments with distinct spending patterns.  
- Visualization helps understand key differences between clusters.  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saramohamed-d/Customer-Segmentation.git
